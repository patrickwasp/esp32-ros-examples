This directory is intended for project specific colcon packages. 
PlatformIO will add them to the build process.

You can copy them the packages directky, create symbolic links to them from the src directory, 
or create a extra_packages.repos yaml file to clone them from a git repository.

After adding new packages, you will need to force a clean recompile.

in a PIO terminal run the following commands

```bash
pio run --target clean_microros
pio lib install
pio run
